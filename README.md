## Application Description

On the front page of our application, the GUI will prompt the user to upload or capture an
image of a room with furniture in it. The backend of our application will be able to process
uploaded images in a way that will yield a list of recognized furniture items. The uploaded
image will be colored in to highlight the detected furniture items and displayed in the GUI.
Simultaneously, a list will be made available to the user from which they can choose furniture
items for removal. The application backend will remove any chosen furniture objects from the
image and, using context information, fill the resulting whitespace as accurately as possible.
Finally, the application will output the finished result of the image processing to the GUI.
